###CPI at 8.5%

Wooooo! Inflation has peaked... or has it. Just kidding, it most likely has as we see a huge drop in YoY headline CPI which means we are past what we presume is the worst of this crisis we have been in. I'm glad that we have sort of flatlined in the month to month price gauges and can now focus on maintaining this trend to the FED's desired 2% rate. I do think that this is what Chairman Powell was looking for and will give him the basis to move towards the 50 BPS hike in Sept followed by two 25 BPS hikes before the flat or pivot.
