Please join me for some casual talk on whats happening this week!

### CPI at 8.5% ============================================================================

Wooooo! Inflation has peaked... or has it. Just kidding, it most likely has as we see a huge drop in YoY headline CPI which means we are 
past what we presume is the worst of this crisis we have been in. I'm glad that we have sort of flatlined in the month to month price 
gauges and can now focus on maintaining this trend to the FED's desired 2% rate. I do think that this is what Chairman Powell was looking 
for and will give him the basis to move towards the 50 BPS hike in Sept followed by two 25 BPS hikes before the flat or pivot.

What this means for the forward market. Well thats the million-dollar question. Equities and other risk assets can now be pricing in an easing 
quantitative pressure. Afterall, this bottom came in with the US hosting the most investor cash on the sidelines in recent history. The sellers 
have sold out and theres a long runway for bulls to prop up the ridiculous valuations we saw in growth names a year ago. This is good for the 
tech industry as companies can now focus on allocating capital towards maintaining their workforces and deployment of products as opposed to 
the doom and gloom we were seeing just 3 months ago. Again, we are in a time where record inflation was coupled with decent to average 
earnings, not bad ones. There's a saying that the market is at the will of sentiment. This is true because earlier in the summer, the market 
was fully convinced that a deep severe recession was in our sightline. With this being ever so wrong, companies still took precautionary measures
to ensure against the all-hell-broke-loose scenario and that is why things seemed scarier than they were. Now that we have better optics of what
may lie ahead, risk assets are recouping their losses on the year. 

As for recession. We may be in a technical recession but if the labour and equity markets say otherwise, we are not in a real recession. GDP down 
less than a percent is a rounding error less so the signaling of another 2008. GDP growth should be resilient in the future quarters and should
be aligned with the growth of consumer confidence coming out of all time lows.
