# Week 2!

###Homewards

This has been my first week back from New York City and all I can say is that I have never been more glad to be back in the suburbs. 
The speed at which the city moves can be exhausting and its nice to have the change pace downwards. 

There is so much solace in stability and home provides that when you need it most. It i very easy to deviate towards chaos. 
Physics suggest everything moves towards instability and that is most definitely true in a metaphysical sense. Our minds when bored
want something exciting and excitement is often in the realm of chaos.
